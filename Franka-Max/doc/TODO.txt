Here is an approximate plan of what should be done as a first step towards Franka Max:
1. Define all objects on the workspace and place/mark them (Assume position is fixed)
2. Create a task in WEB API to pick up part and deliver it to a specific place in air, wait for user confirmation, release
3. In python, write a script that releases brakes, goes to home pos, starts task above.
4. Create all needed pick/place tasks (4-5 in total?)
5. In Python, add those 4-5 tasks and make a menu what to do 
6. Add various intentinputs from slides and randomize what is asked.
7. Work on Return Status
8. Work on stop/resume motions.
9. Next?


find a way to read robot's status, need to know if its busy doing something or idle
